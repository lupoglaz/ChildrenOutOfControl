# Kids are out of control

So this is our entry to GMTK game jam. Here's sort of design document. You play as a dog trying to get kids under control. Your main weapon is barking. The kids can react to your bark differently depending on their personality. Your goal is to avoid kids getting killed or breaking something.

## Types of kids
* Normal kid: wanders around aimlessly, when hears you bark runs from you, breaks valuable things only if bumps into them

* Curious kid: wanders around aimlessly, when hears you bark runs towards you, looks for valuable things and breaks them

* Violent kid: wanders around aimlessly, when hears you bark runs from you, looks for other kids and scares them (they run from him), looks for valuable things and breaks them

* Malevolent kid: wanders around aimlessly, when hears you bark runs from you, creates hazards from valuable things, not affected by them.


## Types of things

* Hazards: if a kid collides with a hazzard, gameover

* Goal cell: if a kid collides with this cell, it's rescued

* Valuable things: if a kid breaks it, you loose points


## Goal

Rescue all the kids
